    "### Exploratory analysis\n",
    "What you do to understant the data and figure out what might be noteworthy or interesting to highlight to others.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explanatory analysis\n",
    "After figure out important key points in the exploratory analysis, turn the data into information that can be consumed by an audience. \n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.1 Who, what and how\n",
    "1. To whom are you communicating? \n",
    " - important to have a good understanding of who your audience is and how they perceive you.\n",
    " - knowing well specific audience needs.\n",
    " - establish good relationship with audience, it may impact the order and flow of the overall story you aim to tell.\n",
    "2. What do you want your audience to know or do?\n",
    " - how you want your audience to act and take into account how you will communicate to them and the overall tone that you want to set for your communication.\n",
    " - How to make what you communicate relevant for your audience and forma clear understanding of why they should care what you say. How audience react with the communication.\n",
    " - How will you communicate to your audience? - the method for communication.\n",
    "3. How can you use data to help make your point?\n",
    " - What data is available that will help to make my point? \n",
    "\n",
    "### Glossary\n",
    "To build a communication, think about answering these questions for them up front:\n",
    "\n",
    "• What background information is relevant or essential?\n",
    "\n",
    "• Who is the audience or decision maker? What do we know about them?\n",
    "\n",
    "• What biases does our audience have that might make them supportive of or resistant to our message?\n",
    "\n",
    "• What data is available that would strengthen our case? Is our audience familiar with this data, or is it new?\n",
    "\n",
    "• Where are the risks: what factors could weaken our case and do we need to proactively address them?\n",
    "\n",
    "• What would a successful outcome look like?\n",
    "\n",
    "• If you only had a limited amount of time or a single sentence to tell your audience what they need to know, what would you say?\n",

    "# Chapter 2: Choosing an effective visual\n",
    "There are some visualization tools need to be avoided:\n",
    "- pie charts, donut charts, 3D, and secondary y-axes\n",
    "\n",
    "# Chapter 3: Clutter is your enemy\n",
    "## 3.1. Cognitive load\n",
    "Perhaps without explicitly recognizing it, the presence of clutter in our visual communications can cause a less‐than‐ideal—or worse—uncomfortable user experience for our audience.\n",
    "\n",
    "Principles of visual perception:\n",
    "1. Proximity\n",
    " - arrange subjects as distinct groups or clusters. \n",
    "2. Similarity\n",
    " - Objects that are similar color, shape, size, or orientation are perceived as related or belonging to part of a group.\n",
    "3. Enclosure\n",
    " - The objects that are physically enclosed together as belonging to part of group. Highlight the importance of objects for purpose.\n",
    "4. Closure\n",
    " - The closure concept says that people like things to be simple and to fit the constructs that are already in our heads.\n",
    "5. Continuity\n",
    " - Similar to closure: when looking at objects, our eyes seek the smoothest path and naturally create continuity in what we see even where it may not explicitly exist.\n",
    "6. Connection\n",
    " - We tend to think of objects that are physically connected as part of a group. The connective property typically has a stronger associative value than similar color, size, or shape.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3.2. Lack of visual order\n",
    "Make the graph to the best look and highlight important information.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Alignment\n",
    "The layout is arranged thoughtful that is easy to follow the context\n",
    "### Decluttering\n",
    "Remove all unnecessary elements to drive confusion of attention\n",
    "\n",
    "# Chapter 4: focus your audience's attention\n",
    "Leading audience'attention from the macro to the micro parts of the story,e.g. changing bar's color for each desired level.\n",
    "\n",
    "Highlight one aspect can make other things harder to see.\n",
    "\n",
    "Color, size and front of text or graph in easy way to be attention\n",
    "\n",
    "# Chapter 5: think like a designer\n",
    "1. Highlight the important stuff\n",
    " - make the important stuff so special to see\n",
    "2. Eliminate distractions\n",
    " - know where is important info. to deliver to audience, and explain them in easy way to read.\n",
    "3. Create a clear visual hierarchy of information\n",
    " - grouping, categories elements in easy way to follow\n",
    "4. Accessibility\n",
    " - don't overcomplicate\n",
    "5. Aesthetics\n",
    " - be smart with color\n",
    " - pay attention to alignment\n",
    " - leverage white space\n",
    "6. Acceptance\n",
    " - Articulate the benefits of the new or different approach.\n",
    " - Show the side-by-side\n",
    " - Provide multiple options and seek input\n",
    " - Get a vocal member of your audience on board\n",
    "\n",
    "# Chapter 6: dissecting model visual\n",
    "1. line graph\n",
    " - Everything is titled and labeled, so there is no question about what we looking at.\n",
    "2. annotated line graph with forecast\n",
    " - Numeric data labels are included for the forecast data points to give the audience clearly understanding of forward-looking expectations\n",
    "3. 100% stacked bars\n",
    "4. leveraging positive and negative stacked bars\n",
    "5. horizontal stacked bars\n",
    "\n",
    "# Chapter 7: lession in storytelling\n",
    "1. find a subject you care about\n",
    "2. do not ramble, though\n",
    "3. keep it simple\n",
    "4. have the guts to cut\n",
    "5. sound like yourself\n",
    "6. say what you meant to say\n",
    "7. pity the readers\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tactics to help ensure that your story is clear\n",
    "1. Horizontal logic\n",
    " - The idea behind horizontal logic is that you can read just the slide title of each slide throughout your deck and, together, these snippets tell the overarching story you want to communicate. It is important to have action titles (not descriptive titles) for this to work well.\n",
    " - e.g. slide a, b, c,..., summary\n",
    "2. Vertical logic\n",
    " - Vertical logic means that all information on a given slide is self‐reinforcing. The content reinforces the title and vice versa. The words reinforce the visual and vice versa. There isn’t any extraneous or unrelated information. Much of the time, the decision on what to eliminate or push to an appendix is as important (sometimes more so) as the decision on what to retain.\n",
    " - e.g. Titled the topic, explanation and graph in one slide.\n",
    "3. Reverse storyboarding\n",
    " - When you storyboard at the onset of building a communication, you craft the outline of the story you intend to tell. As the name implies, reverse storyboarding does the opposite. You take the final communication, flip through it, and write down the main point from each page (it’s a nice way to test your horizontal logic as well). The resulting list should look like the storyboard or outline for the story you want to tell. If it doesn’t, this can help you understand structurally where you might want to add, remove, or move pieces around to create the overall flow and structure for the story that you’re interested in conveying.\n",
    " - e.g. slide a, b, c for details, the final slide to drive the attention\n",

    "# Chapter 8: pulling it all together\n",
    "- understand the context\n",
    "- choose an appropriate display\n",
    "- eliminate clutter\n",
    "- Draw attention where you want it\n",
    "- think like a designer\n",
    "- tell a story, e.g.:\n",
    " - understand how prices have changed over time in the competive landscape.\n",
    " - use this knowledge to inform the pricing of our product\n",
    " - end with a specific recommendation\n",
